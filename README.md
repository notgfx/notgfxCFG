## Very important!

Change your **sensitivity** in *\tf\custom\notgfx\cfg\sens_var.cfg*  
And your other **settings** in *\tf\custom\notgfx\cfg\settings.cfg*  
Finnaly, **binds** you can find in *\tf\custom\notgfx\cfg\binds.cfg*

Also you need to change your settings preferably in cfg's from config pack, not from the game menu.  
Changes from the game menu or console do **not** affect the final setting and will not be saved.
