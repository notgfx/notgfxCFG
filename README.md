# notgfxCFG

[![Build Status]]

1. How to install:

Extract the archive to any convenient place, copy the contents of "notgfx cfg v1.1.x" to the Team Fortress 2 folder.
You can find your Team Fortress 2 in steam > library > Team fortress 2 properties > Local files > Browse local files
By default its "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2"
And if you change the path to the other folder, its "X:\SteamLibrary\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2", where "x" - your disc character.

2. How to uninstall: 

You need to delete "custom" folder and hud files: PVHUD.exe, ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib.dll.
If you still see some parts of my config in your game, and if you dont create backup of your "cfg" folder, just download and install default config:

3. How to update:

Just delete the config as described in step two and then setup the new version, as described in step one!
