//The gist of this script is: we have three states. Bullet selected, explosive selected, and fire selected.
//When bullet is selected, we make the 'go to bullet' button do nothing, whereas the other two advance one, and update their current state.
//This way, you can continually hit a key, which will advance state, until you hit your current desired state, and it will stop advancing.
//We always start on spawn with bullet, so we set bullet blank, as to not change resist type
